# CH-CountryOfOrigin
Company registrations by Country of Origin for the basic Companies House data.

## tl;dr 
Using the [basic Companies House data](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html), I calculate the registrations by `Country of Origin`. For those from the UK, I further separate them by country. The code creates (i) a donut pie chart and a (ii) sunburst. They are both interactive and supported by `plotly`.

## Files
